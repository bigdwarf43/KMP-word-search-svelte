# KMP Pattern searching

Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in a notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern-searching algorithms are used to show the search results. The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having the same sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst-case complexity to O(n). 

The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match.


This is a simple implementation of the algorithm which is used to search for patterns in some text.
